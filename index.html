			The Janet Planet
	  </h1>
  	<p>
	  	hello! nice to see you! ^_^
  	<br><br>
  		if you hadn’t guessed, I’m Janet - this is a planet  inhabited entirely by Janet(s), you see!
  	<br><br>
  		please note that there may be additional Janets hiding here somewhere. I’ve never seen them, but Janets are famously good at hiding!
  	<br><br>
  		proof: there’s a Janet hiding, somewhere on your planet, right now. no one has ever found her. if you want to try to find her, good luck! you’ll need it!
  	</p>

  	<h2>
  		Fun Facts about this Janet in particular:
  	</h2>
  	<p>
  		fact 1: I am a Janet.
  	<br><br>
  		fact 2: as a Janet, my lifespan is beyond mere mortal comprehension. even the very concept of a lifespan as it applies to me would make no sense to you. for simplicity, let’s say I am 19 “years” “old”.
  	<br><br>
  		fact 3: I like hugs. hugs are good. do you want some hugs? if not, the next thing I say in this fact doesn’t apply to you: <i>*hugs*</i>
  	<br><br>
  		fact 4: facts are fun! but I should probably stop giving facts now! sorry, but you know how it is - two may facts sproil the brooth!
  	<br><br>
  		fact 5: 5 is equal to ((), (()), ((), (())), ((), (()), ((), (()))), ((), (()), ((), (())), ((), (()), ((), (())))))*
  	<br><br>
  		*fact 5 is only kinda accurate, really - that mess of brackets is a <i>representation</i> of 5 through sets, but it's close enough to being true to be a fun fact :D
