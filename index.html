    <h1>The Janet Planet</h1>
      <p>hello! nice to see you! ^_^</p>
      <p>if you hadn’t guessed, I’m Janet - this is a planet  inhabited entirely by Janet(s), you see!</p>
      <p>please note that there may be additional Janets hiding here somewhere. I’ve never seen them, but Janets are famously good at hiding!</p>
      <p>proof: there’s a Janet hiding, somewhere on your planet, right now. no one has ever found her. if you want to try to find her, good luck! you’ll need it!</p>
      <br>
    <h2>Fun Facts about this Janet in particular:</h2>
    <p>fact 1: I am a Janet.
    <br><br>fact 2: as a Janet, my lifespan is beyond mere mortal comprehension. even the very concept of a lifespan as it applies to me would make no sense to you. for simplicity, let’s say I am 20 “years” “old”.
    <br><br>fact 3: I like hugs. hugs are good. do you want some hugs? if not, the next thing I say in this fact doesn’t apply to you: <i>*hugs*</i>
    <br><br>fact 4: facts are fun! but I should probably stop giving facts now! sorry, but you know how it is - two may facts sproil the brooth!
    <br><br>fact 5: 5 is equal to ((), (()), ((), (())), ((), (()), ((), (()))), ((), (()), ((), (())), ((), (()), ((), (())))))*
    <br><br>fact 6: have some inexplicable toki pona! this is definitely how facts work. <div class="linja-pona">toki! mi pona tan ni: mi sona e sina. o pona</div>
    <br><br>*fact 5 is only kinda accurate, really - that mess of brackets is a <i>representation</i> of 5 through sets, but it's close enough to being true to be a fun fact :D
